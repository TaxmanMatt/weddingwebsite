        <br>Gifts can never replace memories, so your attendance is all that we could ask.
        <br>For those who wish to contribute towards a wedding gift, we have the following suggestions:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        1) We have a short list of specific items. Get in touch with either of us to claim a gift.
            <br><br>
        2) Anonymous EFT donations can be wired into either the bride or groom's account with reference "Walker Wedding". 
            <br><br>
        3) Small donations can be placed in a marked box as you arrive at the ceremony.
            <br><br>
        4) If you already had something specific in mind, it will most certainly make a wonderful addition to our home.
            <br><br>
        5) Matthew insists on bitcoin donations, or any shitcoin for that matter.
